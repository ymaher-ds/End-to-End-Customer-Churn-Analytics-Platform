# 📊 End-to-End Customer Churn Analytics Platform

An end-to-end **AI automation system** that predicts customer churn, deploys the model as an API, and provides an interactive dashboard for business insights.  

Built using the **Iranian Churn Dataset (UCI ML Repository)**, this project demonstrates the complete Data Science workflow: from **data ingestion → feature engineering → model training → API deployment → monitoring dashboard**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major business challenge, especially in telecom. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project builds a **churn prediction platform** to help businesses identify customers likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data exploration and feature engineering.
- Multiple ML models trained & compared (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Best model deployed as a **FastAPI REST service**.
- **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive predictions and monitoring.
- Emphasis on **business impact** (how churn reduction translates into revenue savings).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **ML & Data Science**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization & Dashboarding**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
- **Deployment**: FastAPI, Docker, AWS EC2
- **Experiment Tracking (optional)**: MLflow

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Iranian Churn Dataset** – UCI ML Repository  
- **Rows**: ~3,150 customers  
- **Features**: 13 (e.g., subscription length, call failures, complaints, tariff plan, age group, usage statistics)  
- **Target**: Churn (binary: Yes/No)  
- **Link**: [UCI Dataset Page](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset)

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition & EDA**  
   - Exploratory analysis, churn distribution, feature relationships.  
2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Encoding categorical variables, scaling, engineered features (ratios, complaint-based).  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Compare baseline vs advanced ML models.  
   - Handle class imbalance (SMOTE, class weights).  
   - Select best-performing model (AUC, F1-score).  
4. **API Deployment**  
   - Model wrapped in FastAPI, containerized with Docker, deployed to cloud.  
5. **Monitoring Dashboard**  
   - Interactive Streamlit app for predictions, churn analysis, and drift monitoring.  

---

## 📊 Results

- **Best Model**: XGBoost (AUC = 0.87, F1 = 0.81)  
- **Business Impact Simulation**:  
  - Reducing churn by just **5%** could save ~$XYZ revenue annually (based on assumed customer lifetime value).  

*(Add final numbers after experiments.)*

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add more advanced monitoring (concept drift detection, model retraining triggers).
* Expand dataset with temporal features (usage per month).
* Deploy on **Kubernetes** for scalability.
* Integrate **MLflow** for experiment tracking.
